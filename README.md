# Linux-Pipe-and-Shell
This project focuses on developing a basic shell in C for Linux, serving as a crucial interface between users and the operating system. The shell executes commands entered by users, manages system resources, and supports advanced features like input/output redirection, background process handling, and piping between commands. The inclusion of pipe functionality allows chaining commands, enhancing the shell's versatility for automating tasks and streamlining workflows within the Linux environment. Implementing core functionalities such as command parsing, process management, and signal handling, this project showcases proficiency in system-level programming and efficient shell design principles.
